# TEST - DECK STEALS #

Specs

Here are the rules of the game:
• Two players are dealt the same number of cards from a shuffled deck.
• Each player takes it in turns to place their next card on a pile between them.
• If the two top cards on the pile match in numeric value (e.g. 9 == 9), the last player to place a card takes all the cards in the pile.
• The game continues until one player is out of cards.

Note

This is a technical test.<br/>

TIME: 150 minutes (for a clean OO version).<br/>
