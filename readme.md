Specs
-----
Here are the rules of the game:<br/>
. Two players are dealt the same number of cards from a shuffled deck<br/>
. Each player takes it in turns to place their next card on a pile between them<br/>
. If the two top cards on the pile match in numeric value (e.g. 9 == 9), the last player to place a card takes all the cards in the pile<br/>
. The game continues until one player is out of cards

Note
----
This is a technical test.<br/>
TIME: 90 minutes (for a working draft).<br/>
TIME: 150 minutes (for a clean OO version).<br/>
